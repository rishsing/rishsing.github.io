        <p>In this project, we were presented with a real scenario where new technology was being introduced to firefighters in Bloomington, Indiana. Called <strong>resc.info</strong>, the technology is designed to deliver the right information that firefighters need at different points in a response. <strong>But exactly how to deliver that information, on what devices and in what form was upto us to design.</strong></p>

            <p>The first order of business for us was to understand the process firefighters follow in a response. From the get go, there were some pertinent questions that needed to be answered. We were mainly interested in understanding how they are trained and how they prepapre themselves to respond to an emergency. Therefore, we came up with the following questions for user interviews:
            <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>What information do you get from dispatch and in what form ?</li>
            <li>What do you do after you get a call from dispatch ? Why do you follow that process ?</li>
            <li>What information do you exactly need regarding, say a building fire and how does that help you handle the emergency?</li>
            <li>How comfortable are you with technology ? What role does technology play in day to day operations ? Do you view technology as a source of information only or can it contribute more to your day to day information ?
</li>
            <li>Do you, as a firefighter, want information specific to your role ?</li>
            <li>What is the most basic information that you need that you absolutely cannot work without ?</li>
            <li>What does a typical dispatch message look like ?</li>

                           <p> What we found was: 
                           <ul style="font-size:20px"> 
                           <li> Firefighters use <strong>Mobile Data Terminals</strong>, a robust laptop mounted on the dashboard of their trucks when they are enroute to a scene. </li><br>
                           <li>Firefighters are <strong> not able to use the system to its fullest capacity.</strong> The MDT is relatively new to them and has a cluttered interface. As of now, they only use it for locating hydrants and viewing office/apartment numbers in a building.</li><br>
                           <li>Firefighters want to see the <strong> history of emergencies</strong> that took place in the building they are responding to, any <strong>hazardous materials </strong>that might be present in that building and the <strong> building floor plan.</strong></li><br>
                           <li>The<strong> passenger uses the system</strong> when his attention is divided. He’s helping the chauffeur navigate the fire truck during a bumpy, fast paced ride.
</li><br>
                           <li> When firefighters get to the scene, their <strong>instinct</strong> takes over and their action is dictated by training and previous experience. </li><br>
                           <li> There is a <strong>general lack of funding </strong>for new investments in technology. The MDT system is the only upgrade of technology they’ve received in over a decade.

                           From our research and insights, we concluded that the <strong>MDT system does not give the firefighters the right information when they need it and is difficult to operate during the ride.</strong> The system is potentially life saving but owing to its cluttered interface, the firefighters do not know how to use it.<br><br>
                           Also, given the <strong> budget constraints that the fire department had</strong>, we decided to <strong>constraint ourselves to designing for laptops that firefighters already have in their trucks</strong>. We designed for the time when they are driving to the scene because thats when they are using the system. Once they arrive on scene, their instinct takes over. We decided to design for a scenario in which involved the firefighters are responding to a structure fire.

           <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p> Given what’s at stake in every call, we wanted to create a simple interface that firefighters can use easily. Because we want to give them the most relevant information in a fire call, we decided to include information regarding :
                            <ul style="font-size:20px">
                            <li>Building Plan </li>
                            <li>History of emergencies(that took place in that building) </li>
                            <li>Hydrant Location</li>
                            <li>Hazard Information</li>
                            </ul></p><p>This list of information categories is based on the interview we conducted with the firefighters.<br><br>
                            Now, since no two fire calls are the same, firefighters must adjust their planning for each call. Therefore, we thought it would be helpful to give them the ability to <strong> customize </strong> the information they see on the display. So, to do that, we decided to have toggle buttons to toggle on and off the information they see from each of the four categories. </p>

                 <div class="col-lg-6">
                 <p>To make MDTs more easy to operate, we decided to break the <strong> keyboard</strong> into <strong>four quadrants</strong> wherein each quadrant corresponds to one of the four categories. Pressing keys in any quadrant will toggle on and off the information from that corresponding category. For instance, keys on the top-left side of the keyboard will toggle on & off 'History'. <br><br>Firefighters must use this system while driving at high speeds and may be wearing gloves, so we decided to make the area with which they control the system large.</p>

 <li><strong>Designing in context is very important.</strong> A product is successful only if it can be used by its intended users easily and effectively. Almost every product is used in some context or the other. The Mobile Data Terminal is used by firefighters when they are wearing their heavy gear are enroute to a scene. This essentially means using a laptop with thick, heavy gloves during a speedy and bumpy ride. Its easy to see how that made using the MDT difficult. So if we were to design anything that the firefighters could use, we had to recognize the context in which they would use our product. This tremendously impacted the usability of our product and guided our thought process.</li>
