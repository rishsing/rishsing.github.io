                    	  Hi there ! I am Rishabh Singh. <br><br>

I am a 1st year masters students studying Human-Computer Interaction/design at Indiana University, Bloomington. Prior to this, I was working at a start up in India where I was in charge of advertising, branding and website design. I did my undergrad in Computer Science where I developed a key understanding of how applications, software and websites are developed and deployed. <br><br>

Through design, I aim to improve people’s lives and their experiences with technology. User Experience design problems have always intrigued me and the fact that we can directly impact the user’s life is what motivates me to keep going. I truly believe that, using design, we can bring a positive social change. The possibility of bringing about this change prompted me to fly half-way across the world and take up Human Computer Interaction as my field of study.  <br><br>



Other than designing, I enjoy playing basketball and cricket. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives. Trying out new cuisines is my favorite hobby. <br><br>

                           <p>Uber is offering rides to millions of riders everyday by seamlessly connecting riders to drivers through its app. However, in order to have the success its enjoying today, Uber needed to develop a peer-to-peer service that people could trust. This required identifying problematic riders and drivers so that they could be kept away from the system. This identification of problematic users happened (and continues to happen) though Uber’s rating system, which has come under a lot of scrutiny from the media and drivers. As a result, <strong> we were asked to improve the experience of Uber's current rating system.</strong> <br><br>

Not aware of the faults in the current rating system, it was imperative for us to ask, for instance, why the rating system is in place, how is it being used and who is it being used by (stakeholders). We prepared a list of good questions which we planned to use during the interviews with the drivers and riders
                           
                           </p></div>

                               <div class="modal-content1"><h3>Research, Insights & Problem Identification</h3><hr class="modal_seperator">
                           
                           <p>As a part of our research, we interviewed two drivers and two riders and asked them about their experiences with the rating system and how they use it. We went through Uber driver’s forum and read their experiences. We also looked into the rating system of different e-commerce websites such as Amazon and eBay.  <br><br>
                           
                           What we found was:
                           
                           <ul style="font-size:20px"> 
                           <li> If a driver’s rating falls below 4.6, he/she loses his/her access to the platform and is deactivated. </li>
                           <li> Different people give different ratings for the same/similar ride experience. For instance, the two riders we interviewed stated that one of them, by default gave a 4 star rating for an ordinary ride where as the other rider gave a 5 for the same ride experience. So even if the driver is doing nothing wrong, he/she, in most cases, is still being given a 4 star rating. This brings his/her aggregate lower and eventually closer to 4.6 This highlights the highly subjective nature of the rating system.</li>
                           <li> Riders are not educated as to what the rating system means and how they should be applying it. </li>
                           <li>The drivers don’t know why they are being rated badly. The current system doesn’t tell them that. Hence they don’t  get a realistic chance of improving their performance before getting fired. </li>
                           </ul><br>

                       Therefore, we wanted to create a system that:<br>
                       <h4 class="fontcolor"> Provides specific & accurate feedback to the drivers while keeping user interaction to a minimum.  </h4><br><br>

                           <li> Is <strong>unambiguous </strong>for the user to use. </li>
                           <li> Provides <strong>specific feedback </strong> to drivers. </li>
                           <li> <strong>Minimises subjectivity </strong> and <strong>user interaction</strong>. </li>
                           
                           </ul></p>
                           
                           
                           <p>So we went back to the drawing board and brainstormed as to what constitutes a ride experience. We combined the result of that brainstorming session with the top 5 complaints riders have had in the past with Uber rides. We then arrived at the top 6 aspects of Uber's (and by extension the driver's) service a passenger is more likley to rate his/her ride on. They are:<br>
                           
                           <ul style="font-size:20px">
                          
                          <li> Driver's punctuality</li> 
                          <li>Driver's behavior</li>
                          <li>Driver's driving ability</li>
                          <li>Driver's route knowledge</li>
                          <li> Car Cleanliness</li>
                          <li>Whether or not the car was odor free</li>
                          
                           </ul></p></div>

                          <p> We then decided to allow the user to rate his/her ride experience on these six aspects. After coming up with a dozen concepts and completing two rounds of usability testing, we refined our final design.</p><br><br></div>

                          <p>
                          After the ride, the user is greeted with screen 1 for feedback or for rating his/her ride. The user is required to tap on the aspects of his/her ride experience he/she didn’t like. Tapping on any of the six cards will flip the card and change it to red. For instance, if the user taps on ‘Driver was on-time‘ as a way of saying that the driver was late or not on time, then the card will flip and change its color to red. The tick will disappear and label will change to ‘Driver was late‘ as is shown in screen 2.

                          <p> We introduced the ‘Report the Driver‘ button for more severe problems that a rider may encounter during his/her ride. If the rider faced any of the problems not mentioned in that list, he/she will be motivated to take that extra step to report the problem. The problems mentioned in the listed is taken from Uber’s data that highlights the most probable reasons drivers get a 1 star rating.  </p>

                             <p><strong>We went with this design because we wanted the riders to let Uber and, more importantly, their drivers know whatever he/she were doing right as well as where they were going wrong. This specific feedback will help the drivers identify their short-comings and at the same time provide reassurance for the things they were doing right.<br><br>
                             We preselected all the [positive] options beforehand and asked the users to tap on things they didn’t like about the ride because users are generally more motivated to provide negative
feedback (owing to frustrations that the experience caused them) rather than a positive one. For example, even though the driver is driving nicely and the car is clean and odor free, the riders will seldom notice it because they might be busy using their phones, checking emails, texting etc and hence are not likely to provide any feedback regarding that. But if the driver is driving rashly or if the car is dirty and smelly, riders are more likely to notice that because it is something that is causing them discomfort. This motivates them to rate that aspect of their experience.

                            In this project I learned that:
<ol>
 <li><strong>User research is important:</strong> Its impossible to identify problems solely by researching about it on the internet. Conducting interviews and talking to users gives you some very important and relevant insights.</li> <br>

<li><strong>Constraints can be a good thing:</strong> In this project we constrained ourselves to designing a rating system that is unambiguous, accurate and provides specific feedback. This gave us direction and guided our design process.</li>

                            <p>Online forums are a very popular web service that have somehow managed to survive the last two decades without needing to change or evolve from its original design significantly. Online forums have the same basic design as they did when they started being used in the 80’sThey have maintained the same thread-based design of an initial post and subsequent comments, and yet continue being very popular among users. However, the current design do seem to have some pitfalls. <strong>Catching up with whats going on in a thread is difficult (especially if it has a large number of comments), the design is unaesthetic and users need to feel motivated to understand whats being communicated.</strong> <br><br>

                            <p> Therefore, the challenge was to <strong>re-design forums that addresses these and any other pitfalls in general.</strong> Considering the fact that there are several different types of forums out there and each of them are being used for different purposes, it was imperative for us to hone in on a particular type of forum and target users. We chose the LGBT community as our target user because they are one of the most active forum users and forums have played a big part in spreading awareness regarding their issues and helped bring a revolution online.</p>

                             For our research, we interviewed Doug Bauder, Office Coordinator (GLBT Office @ Indiana University) and Jamie Bartzel Office Supervisor (GLBT Office @ Indiana University). The primary purpose of this interview was to understand the motivation behind using forums by the users from the queer community. We also talked to a couple of students and asked them about the difficulties they faced growing up regarding their sexual orientation.<br><br>
                             We found that users from the queer community go to forums because:
                             <ul>
                             <li>It allows them to search for information <strong>anonymously</strong>.</li>
                             <li>It is one of the few platforms where they can <strong>get advice</strong> and read other <strong>people’s experiences</strong>.</li>

                           <p>In this project, we were presented with a real scenario where new technology was being introduced to firefighters in Bloomington, Indiana. Called resc.info the technology is designed to deliver the right information that firefighters need at different points in a response. <strong>But exactly how to deliver that information, on what devices and in what form was upto us to design.</strong> <br><br>

However, in order to design something that the firefighters could use, it was imperative for us to understand the process firefighters follow in a response. So, we interviewed firefighters at the University Station to get an understanding of how they respond to an emergency and what information they currently use. We also wanted to learn what kind of technology they already use and how technology ready they were.

                           <p>
                           For purposes of our research, we interviewed <strong>David Wild</strong> (Associate Professor @ Indiana University), <strong>Jon Musgrave</strong> (Captain @ Station 3) and other<strong> firefighters at University Station, Bloomington, Indiana.</strong><br><br>
                           
                           What we found was:
                           <ul>
                           <li> Firefighters use <strong>Mobile Data Terminals</strong>, a robust laptop mounted on the dashboard of their trucks when they are enroute to a scene. </li>
                           <li>Firefighters are <strong> not able to use the system to its fullest capacity.</strong> The MDT is relatively new to them and has a cluttered interface. As of now, they only use it for locating hydrants and viewing office/apartment numbers in a building.</li>
                           <li>Firefighters want to see the <strong> history of emergencies</strong> that took place in the building they are responding to, any <strong>hazardous materials </strong>that might be present in that building and the <strong> building floor plan.</strong></li>
                           <li>The<strong> passenger uses the system</strong> when his attention is divided. He’s helping the chauffeur navigate the fire truck during a bumpy, fast paced ride.
</li>
                           <li> When firefighters get to the scene, their <strong>instinct</strong> takes over and their action is dictated by training and previous experience. </li>
                           <li> There is a <strong>general lack of funding </strong>for new investments in technology. The MDT system is the only upgrade of technology they’ve received in over a decade.
</li>
                           </ul>
                            
                           </p><br>

                           <div class="row" style="text-align:center">
                           <div class="col-lg-4"> <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/project_photos/firefighter/research.jpeg" style="width:350px"> </div>

                           <div class="modal-content1"><p> From our research and insights, we concluded that the <strong>MDT system does not give the firefighters the right information when they need it and is difficult to operate during the ride.</strong> The system is potentially life saving but owing to its cluttered interface, the firefighters do not know how to use it.<br><br>
                           Also, given the <strong> budget constraints that the fire department had</strong>, we decided to <strong>constraint ourselves to designing for laptops that firefighters already have in their trucks</strong>. We designed for the time when they are driving to the scene because thats when they are using the system. Once they arrive on scene, their instinct takes over. We decided to design for a scenario in which involved the firefighters are responding to a structure fire. <br><br>
                           So for our solution we focused on:<br>
                           <h4 class="fontcolor">Re-designing the MDTs (Mobile Data Terminals) to deliver the right information to the firefighters when they need it.</h4><br><br>

                            <div class="modal-content1"><h3> Design Process</h3><hr class="modal_seperator">
                            
                            <p>  Given what’s at stake in every call, we wanted to create a simple interface that firefighters can use easily. Because we want to give them the most relevant information in a fire call, we decided to include information regarding :
                            <ul>
                            <li>Building Plan </li>
                            <li>History of emergencies(that took place in that building) </li>
                            <li>Hydrant Location</li>
                            <li>Hazard Information</li>
                            </ul>This list of information categories is based on the interview we conducted with the firefighters.<br><br>
                            Since no two fire calls are the same, firefighters must adjust their planning for each call. Therefore, we thought it would be helpful to give them the ability to <strong> customize </strong> the information they see on the display. So, to do that, we decided to have toggle buttons to toggle on and off the information they see from each of the four categories mentioned above.
</p><br>
                            <div class="row">
                            
                            <div class="col-lg-6"> <p> To make MDTs more easy to operate, we decided to break the <strong> keyboard</strong> into <strong>four quadrants</strong> wherein each quadrant corresponds to one of the four categories. Pressing keys in any quadrant will toggle on and off the information from that corresponding category. For instance, keys on the top-left side of the keyboard will toggle on & off 'History'. <br><br>Firefighters must use this system while driving at high speeds and may be wearing gloves, so we decided to make the area with which they control the system large. </p></div>

                            <p> This is the first screen the firefighter sees when he/she enters the truck. On the top right corner the screen is the address of the place where they need to go. On the top-left corner of the screen is the dispatch call. All additional information coming from dispatch will be displayed there. To view the information from any of the category above, the firefighter will have to press keys in the corresponding quadrant.  </p>

                            <p> 
                            So, for instance, pressing keys in the lower right corner of the keyboard will bring up information from 'Hazards' category. The information will mainly be about hazardous materials present in and around the location the fireifghters are responding to. 
                            </p>
                           </div><br>

                            <p> 
                            We made the information silos/layout responsive so that firefighters can see multiple categories at once. No two calls are the same and every call requires an adjustment in their planning. This adjustment, in turn, warrants viewing different sets of information for better planning & preparedness. Therefore, as an example, pressing keys on the top-left corner of the keyboard will bring up information from the 'History' category and the layout will be adjusted to fit in two different sets of information.

                            <p><strong>Designing in context is very important.</strong> A product is successful only if it can be used by its intended users easily and effectively. Almost every product is used in some context or the other. The Mobile Data Terminal is used by firefighters when they are wearing their heavy gear are enroute to a scene. This essentially means using a laptop with thick, heavy gloves during a speed and bumpy ride. Its easy to see how that made using the MDT difficult. So if we were to design anything that the firefighters could use we, had to recognize the context in which they would use our product. So we had to design something  that the firefighters could use while they were wearing their gloves while they are enroute to a scene. This tremendously impacted the usability of our product and guided our thought process.<br>
