        <p>Online forums are a very popular web service that have somehow managed to survive the last two decades without needing to change or evolve from its original design significantly. Online forums have the same basic design as they did when they started being used in the 80’s.They have maintained the same thread-based design of an initial post and subsequent comments, and yet continue being very popular among users. However, the current design do seem to have some pitfalls. <strong>Catching up with whats going on in a thread is difficult (especially if it has a large number of comments), the design is unaesthetic and users need to feel motivated to understand whats being communicated.</strong> Therefore, the challenge was to <strong>re-design forums</strong> that addresses these and any other <strong>pitfalls</strong> in general.</p>

            <p>Considering the fact that there are several different types of forums out there and each of them are being used for different purposes, it was imperative for us to hone in on a particular type of forum and users. We chose the LGBT community as our target user because they are one of the most active forum users in the world. Forums have played a big part in spreading awareness regarding their issues and helped bring a revolution online. Hence, we decided to re-design forums dedicated to the queer community. Next, we came up with the following questions (to be asked during interviews) to better understand our target users & their motivation to use forums. :
            <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>Why do users from the queer community need a dedicated forum ? What do they do there ?</li>
            <li>Why not use social media for the same purpose ?</li>
            <li>What problems do people from the queer community face growing up ?</li>
            <li>Which topics do they need the most help in ?</li>
            <li>How do they express their problems online ?</li>
            <li>What does safety mean to them ?</li>

                          <p>For our research, we interviewed Doug Bauder, Office Coordinator (GLBT Office @ Indiana University) and Jamie Bartzel Office Supervisor (GLBT Office @ Indiana University). The primary purpose of this interview was to understand the motivation behind using forums by the users from the queer community. We also talked to a couple of students and asked them about the difficulties they faced growing up regarding their sexual orientation. </p> </div><br><br></div>

                           <p> We found that users from the queer community go to forums because:

            <p> From the get go we wanted to give forums a facelift. This was also in line with our quest to make it easy for people to find information and navigate around the forum. Users from the queer community make use of <strong> post topics to find what interestes them</strong>. So we decided to make it visually easy to find topics on the homepage. Along with that we introduced <strong> filters using which users can search posts on the basis of race, religion and categories</strong>. </p>

                 <p>On the conversation space side of things, we decided to categorise replies into advice and experiences. Based on our research, users from the queer community mostly go to forums to <strong>seek advice and read other people's experiences.</strong> So we wanted them to be able to sort replies to a post using these two categories. During usability testing we realised that there are a significant amount of posts in all the LGBT forums regarding health issues. A lot of replies to these posts contain links to other websites. Therefore, to make it easy to find information in a conversation space, we decided to allow the user to filter replies based on <strong>whether or not their replies contain links.</strong> </p>

Hence, it was essential to make it easy for users from diverse background to find posts that suit their needs. <br><br> A post can be of different types. It can be about a user asking for views and opinions regarding certain incidents or policy that affect them. On the other hand, it can also be about a user sharing his/her most intimate experiences. Considering how people look for different kinds of posts based on their needs, we included the option of sorting posts based on their type. <br><br></p><p class="content-subheading" style="color:#F97A76"><strong>CONVERSATION SPACE</strong></p><p style="color:#FFFFFF"> We took a similar approach when re-designing the conversation page.

     <p><ol style="font-size:20px">
 <li><strong>Asking good questions is important:</strong> This project taught me how important it is to question why things are the way they are. It made me think hard as to <strong>why users still use forums</strong>; what are they doing there; how do they use it; why don't they use social media for the same purposes etc.  I learned that despite all of forum's shortcomings, people have a strong reason/motivation to use it. Understanding those reasons and motivations is important because it gives you an idea as to <strong> whats important to them in a forum.</strong> Any re-design of the forum is successful only if it seamlessly allows the user to do what is important to him/her in the forum.</li> <br>

<li><strong>Your design is as good as your team:</strong> There was a lot miscommunication and a lot of misunderstandings in the way the three of us worked. Owing to this, we weren't working as one coherent team and that impacted our quality of work. All of this culminated in a heated exchange. After that, we decided to take a day off, met the day after and had a heart-to-heart conversation. That cleared the air but I think we could have done a better job had we worked well as a team. Reflecting on this experience taught me how important it is to be honest and upfront with your team members. It is important to ensure that your ideas are getting across. I learned how such situations can be avoided and resolved.</li>
