        <p>Uber is offering rides to millions of riders everyday by seamlessly connecting riders to drivers through its app. However, in order to have the success its enjoying today, Uber needed to develop a peer-to-peer service that people could trust. This required identifying problematic riders and drivers so that they could be kept away from the system. This identification of problematic users happened (and continues to happen) though Uber’s rating system, which has come under a lot of scrutiny from the media and drivers. As a result, <strong> we were asked to improve the experience of Uber's current rating system.</strong></p>

             <h3 class="content-heading">User Research & Insights</h3>
            <p class="content-subheading"><strong>Asking good questions ! </strong></p>
            <p>In order to design something worthwhile, we first needed to find out what the problems with the current rating system were. One way of doing that was by asking some very good questions to our stakeholders(Uber, users & drivers). Therefore, before delving into user research of any kind, we came up with the following questions, answering which would help us zero in on the root of the problem:
            <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>Why does Uber use a rating system ?</li>
            <li>Why use a 5 star rating system ? Whats wrong with it ?</li>
            <li>What if we use a 3 or a 10 star rating system ?</li>
            <li>How do riders use the rating system ?</li>
            <li>What do riders rate their experience on ?</li>
            </ul></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-lg-6"><img src="img/portfolio/project_photos/uber/questions.jpg" class="img-centered img-responsive"></div></div><br>
            <div class="row"><div class="col-lg-12">
                          <p class="content-subheading"><strong>User Research </strong></p>
                          <p>As a part of our research, we interviewed <strong>two drivers and two riders </strong> and asked them about their experiences with the rating system. More specifically, we picked their brains with the questions we came up with earlier. This, in turn, generated some great follow up questions. We then went through Uber driver’s forum online and read their grievances regarding the rating sytem. We also looked into the rating system of different e-commerce websites such as Amazon and eBay to see how they handle ratings.  </p> </div><br><br></div>
                         <div class="col-lg-12">
                           <p> What we found was:
                           <ul style="font-size:20px"> 
                           <li> If a driver’s rating falls below 4.6, he/she loses his/her access to the platform and is deactivated. </li><br>
                           <li> Different people give different ratings for the same/similar ride experience. For instance, the two riders we interviewed, stated that one of them, by default gave a 4 star rating for an ordinary ride where as the other rider gave a 5 for the same ride experience. So even if the driver is doing nothing wrong, he/she, in most cases, is still being given a 4 star rating. This brings his/her aggregate lower and eventually closer to 4.6 This highlights the highly subjective nature of the rating system.</li><br>
                           <li> Riders are not educated as to what the rating system means and how they should be applying it. </li><br>
                           <li>The drivers don’t know why they are being rated badly. The current system doesn’t tell them that. Hence they don’t  get a realistic chance of improving their performance before getting fired. </li>
                           </ul><br></p>

           <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p> Given the insights we got from our research, we all agreed on creating a system that:
                           
                           <ul style="font-size:20px">
                           
                           <li> Is <strong>unambiguous </strong>for the user to use. </li>
                           <li> Provides <strong>specific feedback </strong> to drivers. </li>
                           <li> <strong>Minimises subjectivity </strong> and <strong>user interaction</strong>. </li>
                           
                           </ul></p>
                           
                           <p>So we went back to the drawing board and brainstormed as to what constitutes a ride experience. We combined the result of that brainstorming session with the top 5 complaints riders have had in the past with Uber rides. We then arrived at the top 6 aspects of Uber's (and by extension the driver's) service a passenger is more likley to rate his/her ride on. They are:<br>
                           
                           <ul style="font-size:20px">
                          
                          <li> Driver's punctuality</li> 
                          <li>Driver's behavior</li>
                          <li>Driver's driving ability</li>
                          <li>Driver's route knowledge</li>
                          <li> Car Cleanliness</li>
                          <li>Whether or not the car was odor free</li>
                          
                           </ul></p>

                             We preselected all the [positive] options beforehand and asked the users to tap on things they didn’t like about the ride because users are generally more motivated to provide negative
feedback (owing to frustrations that the experience caused them) rather than a positive one. For example, even though the driver is driving nicely and the car is clean and odor free, the riders will seldom notice it because they might be busy using their phones, checking emails, texting etc and hence are not likely to provide any feedback regarding that. But if the driver is driving rashly or if the car is dirty and smelly, riders are more likely to notice that because it is something that is causing them discomfort. This motivates them to rate that aspect of their experience.

<li><strong>Constraints can be a good thing:</strong> There are numerous ways the experience of the app could have been improved. This can often lead to paralysis wherein the team can't decide how to proceed. In this project, given the limited time we had on our hands (2 weeks), we constrained ourselves to re-designing the rating system.
